Every computer running SCO TCP/IP has an Internet routing table. It is known as "Kernel Routing Table" or "Kernel Forwarding Table" and is stored in the operating system kernel. This table consists of a series of entries and each entry consists of multiple fields.

Commands : (a) netstat -rn (b) route -n

127.0.0.1 is the loopback address of your local computer, it is the local host. If you ping it - you're pinging yourself. This address is created to test your computerâ€™s networking protocols without actually using the network your computer is connected to.
192.168.1.1 is an IP address of a computer. It is the network created by your router where all networked devices communicate. You can also see and communicate with your own computer by referencing the address it has been assigned, also communicate with any other device on the network.
